I have been a mobile developer, an entrepreneur, a full-stack programmer, a competitive intelligence consultant, a lead software engineer, an engineering manager, a tech strategist, a solution architect and an application architect, in no particular order. I have always been a top performer and a mentor to my peers in the various positions I have held over the past 20+ years. Still learning anything I can.

When I am not working, I am usually spending time with my family, doing some home improvement, keeping up to date with research on financial economics and physics, or cycling around a river somewhere.
